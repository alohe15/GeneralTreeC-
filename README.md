# generaltree
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Build a general tree which will store only a numeric value.  Allow the user to enter two pieces of information - the parent key and the key for the node to be added.  Add each node in arrival sequence.  In order to do this, you must define a node, a position within the tree, and a list.  Let the list be an array (multiply occurring).  Provide the ability to retrieve all of the nodes in post-order sequence.  Also provide the ability to search for a particular value and make sure you address the scenario where I enter a value which does not exist.
